			Akira came directly, [5] breaking all tradition. Was that it?
Had he followed form—had he asked his mother to speak to
his father to approach a go-between—would Chie have been
more receptive? ref-wrapper
He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the door while
a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie
thought him only the wind. The maid 5 knew better. Chie
heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then
the maid brought a calling card to the drawing room, for
Chie.
Chie was reluctant to 15 go to her guest; perhaps she was
feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table
set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides
of the table so their legs were tucked inside with the heat.
“Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie questioned
as she picked the name card off the maid’s lacquer tray.
“Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read. Naomi
recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air.
“I think you should go,” said Naomi.
Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black military-style
uniform of a student. As he bowed—his hands hanging
straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper
umbrella in the other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the
glistening surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
“Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption, but I come
with a matter of urgency.”
His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a
deferential peek at her face.
In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt
herself starting to like him.
“Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your
business can wait for a moment or two.”
“I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would approach
you more properly but I’ve received word of a position. I’ve
an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle’s
Japanese community.”
“Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement. “That is an
opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I involved?”
Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the name card,
Chie had no idea. Akira’s message, delivered like a formal
speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how
children speak so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly
about things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was
eighteen and training endlessly in the arts needed to make a
good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a
husband.
Akira blushed.
“Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I’ve
come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night. “Does
Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?”
“We have an understanding. Please don’t judge my
candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I ask directly
because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either
method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental
approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi’s
yoshi.* We’ll live in the House of Fuji. Without your
consent, I must go to America, to secure a new home for my
bride.”
Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full in the
face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see I’ve startled
you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no more of your
evening. My address is on my card. If you don’t wish to
contact me, I’ll reapproach you in two weeks’ time. Until
then, good night.”
He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace,
like a cat making off with a fish.
“Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and turned from
the door. “He has asked you?”
The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie
strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous.
“Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He thinks
he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the
snap of his fingers!”
Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking
straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke. “I met him at
my literary meeting.”
